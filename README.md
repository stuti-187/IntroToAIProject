# IntroToAIProject

Built on Python version 3.7.4
Latest version is under Phase-2 directory
Under AnalysisAutomatedScripts you can find the automated scripts used to analyse the AI's performance over a range of board size that simulates 100 games.
**Steps to Run**:
1. Before running the program make sure numpy and random libraries are installed
2. Go to the file path of TreeBasedImplementation.py
3. Run the command “python TreeBasedImplementation.py”
4. Enter the AI that you want to play with (1 Baseline/2 Tree-based)
5. Enter an integer for the game size (n) that you want to play
6. To enter the vertices of the edge you want to color input 2 space separated integer values from 0 to (n-1)
7. Make sure you enter valid end points else you will be prompted about your invalid inputs
